<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Rock Paper Scissors** is an interactive simulation of the classic zero-sum hand game, engineered to demonstrate real-time user feedback and state management. The interface acts as a transparent mediator between the user's input and the system's random logic generation.

### HMI Principles
The development of this interface was guided by core **Human-Machine Interaction** paradigms:
*   **System State Visibility**: The UI provides immediate confirmation of user choices and computer counter-moves, ensuring the user never has to guess the system's status.
*   **Response Latency**: The system is optimized for negligible delay between input and result display, maintaining the illusion of a continuous, "live" interaction.

> [!TIP]
> **Feedback & Affordance**
>
> The interactive icons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors rely on strong **Affordances** - their visual design clearly invites clicking. Coupled with the immediate "glow" effect upon selection, the system provides distinct **Visual Feedback**, confirming to the user that their input has been registered and the system state has changed, a critical requirement for highly interactive systems.

<!-- FEATURES -->
<a name="features"></a>
## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Survival Mode** | High-stakes gameplay where every loss depletes a life, challenging players to "survive" against the AI. |
| **Smart AI** | An intelligent opponent that adapts to player patterns, creating a challenging and dynamic experience. |
| **Real-Time Physics** | **Floating Ghost Icons** drift through the background, adding atmospheric depth without distraction. |
| **Premium Analytics** | **High-Fidelity PDF-Ready Share Cards** generated instantly for performance sharing. |
| **Score Tracking** | Persistent high score system using Web LocalStorage to track lifetime bests. |
| **Adaptive UI** | Fully **responsive glassmorphic interface** optimized for mobile, tablet (iPad), and desktop. |
| **Audio Immersion** | Procedural sound generation for game events, complete with a discreet **Mute Toggle**. |

> [!NOTE]
> ### Interactive Polish: The Survival Aesthetic
> We have reimagined the classic game as a "Survival Challenge," introducing a health-point system (Hearts) that transforms a simple pastime into a tension-filled arcade experience. The visual language has been elevated with a **Deep Blue Glassmorphism** theme, ensuring every element - from the floating background particles to the "right-handed" vertical icons - feels purposeful and premium. Complementing this experience, the application includes a high-fidelity performance summary feature, with each shareable scorecard digitally signed by **Amey & Mega**.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Logic**: Vanilla JS (Game Loop & State Management)
- **Imaging**: **html2canvas** (Custom high-fidelity capture engine)
- **UI System**: Premium Glassmorphic Design (Custom Vanilla CSS3)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (Staging & Continuous Delivery Workflow)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
